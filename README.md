# Credits

## Original AMT

*   **~pS|Arezu** - Created the original AMT (Arezu's Mapping Toolbox). Made mapping what it is today - the foundation every mapper builds on.
*   **~pS|Rextox** - Created the images and UI elements

## gute_amt

*   **Zeet** - Combined preview functionality with advanced settings from different AMT versions (with help from Prime on textfield validation). Didn't want credit but getting it anyway.

AMT Extended builds on their work.
